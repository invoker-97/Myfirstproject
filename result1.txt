The physicochemical parameters recorded in all the three lakes are summarised in Table 2. The pH of the lakes ranged between 8.6 to 9.5 and the water temperature was almost similar to the atmospheric temperature. The PGL and TRL samples had high TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) value above 500ppm whereas in TKL the TDS was low. The DO values ranged from 2.11mg ml-1 in Tsokar lake to 6.78 mg ml-1 in Tsomoriri lake. Total salinity was found to be high in all the samples with TKL having the highest salinity 56.78 g/L among the three lakes followed by PGL and TRL. Tsomoriri lake has the highest resistivity (690 ohm.cm) followed by Pangong lake (84 ohm.cm) and Tsokar lake (12 ohm.cm). WHO guidelines for drinking water were taken as reference value and the summary of the elemental composition of all the three hypersaline lakes are listed in Table 2. Alkaline earth metals like Magnesium (Mg) [307710.084 ppb] was the chief composition in PGL followed by Calcium (Ca) [4346.9 ppb], Strontium (Sr) [198.7 ppb] and Barium (Ba) [82.2 ppb] in TRL. While, alkali metals i.e., Sodium (Na) [1742866.3ppb], Potassium (K) [91825.3 ppb] and Lithium (Li) [7090.2 ppb] concentration was highest in PGL sample. In TKL metalloids such as Arsenic (As) [31.1ppb] was adequately present followed by non-mental element Selenium (Se) found only in PGL [2.7 ppb] sample. The other metals present in the samples were Lead (Pb) [max in PGL=30.06 ppb], Aluminium (Al) [max in TRL= 368.8 ppb] Thallium (Tl) [only in TKL=0.03 ppb]. Furthermore, transitional metals such as Vanadium (V), Iron (Fe), Chromium (Cr), Manganese (Mn), Cobalt (Co), Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Cadmium (Cd), Mercury (Hg) and Silver (Ag) were also determined.

The physico-chemical parameters recorded in the three lakes are summarized in Table 2. The pH of the lakes was between 8.6 and 9.5 and the water temperature was almost the same as the atmospheric temperature. The PGL and TRL samples had a high TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) value of over 500 ppm, while TKL had a low TDS value.DO values ​​ranged from 2.11 mg ml-1 in Lake Tsokar to 6.78 mg ml-1 in Lake Tsomoriri. Total salinity was high in all samples, with TKL having the highest salinity among the three lakes at 56.78 g/L, followed by PGL and TRL.Lake Tsomoriri has the highest resistivity (690 ohm.cm), followed by Lake Pangong (84 ohm.cm) and Lake Tsokar (12 ohm.cm). The WHO guidelines for drinking water were used as a reference value and the summary of the elemental composition of the three hypersaline lakes is given in Table 2.Alkaline earth metals such as magnesium (Mg) [307710.084 ppb] were the main composition in PGL, followed by calcium (Ca) [4346.9 ppb], strontium (Sr) [198.7 ppb] and barium (Ba) [82.2 ppb] to TRL .While the alkali metals sodium (Na) [1742866.3 ppb], potassium (K) [91825.3 ppb] and lithium (Li) [7090.2 ppb] the concentration in the PGL sample was higher. Metalloids such as arsenic (As) [31.1 ppb] were abundant in TKL, followed by the non-mental element selenium (Se), which was unique to the PGL sample [2.7 ppb]. The other metals present in the samples were lead (Pb) [maximum at PGL=30.06 ppb], aluminum (Al) [max. in TRL= 368.8 ppb] thallium (Tl) [only in TKL=0.03 ppb]. Also transition metals such as vanadium (V), iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd). In addition, mercury (Hg) and silver (Ag) were determined.
